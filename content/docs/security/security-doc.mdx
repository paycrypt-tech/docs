## Overview
PayCrypt is a production-grade, high-security system. Key security features include:
- JWT authentication for merchant endpoints
- API key authentication for payment endpoints
- Per-route rate limiting
- Input validation and request signing
- Logging middleware for audit trails
- Secure handling of secrets and credentials

## Authentication
- **JWT:** Used for most merchant endpoints. Sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- **API Key:** Used for payment creation. Sent as `X-API-Key` header
- **OAuth:** Google OAuth for registration/login

## Rate Limiting
- Enforced at middleware level per route and per user
- Rate limits are configurable in middleware
- Exceeding the limit returns HTTP 429

## Logging
- Structured logging with request IDs and error tracking
- Logs sensitive actions (auth, payments, key generation)
- Logs are stored securely and monitored for anomalies

## Input Validation
- All incoming requests are validated for required fields and data types
- Invalid requests return 400 with error details

## Best Practices
- Use strong, unique passwords for merchant accounts
- Keep API keys and JWT tokens secret
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use HTTPS in production
- Enable 2FA and IP whitelisting (see roadmap)

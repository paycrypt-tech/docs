description: How to integrate with PayCrypt- API usage, webhooks, SDKs, and message formats.
---

## Overview
This guide covers integrating PayCrypt into your application, including:
- API usage (REST)
- Webhooks for payment notifications
- SDKs (coming soon)
- RabbitMQ message formats

## API Integration
- Obtain an API key via `/api-key/create` (JWT required)
- Use REST endpoints as documented in [API Reference](./api.md)
- Authenticate with `X-API-Key` header for payment endpoints
- Use JWT for merchant endpoints

## Webhooks
- Configure webhook URLs when creating payment links or payments
- PayCrypt will POST payment status updates to your webhook
- Example webhook payload:
```json
{
  "event": "payment_completed",
  "payment_id": "...",
  "amount": 100.0,
  "currency": "USDT",
  "status": "confirmed",
  "timestamp": "..."
}
```
- Handle idempotency and verify signatures (see security.md)

## RabbitMQ Message Formats
- Payment events are published to RabbitMQ for async processing
- Example message (JSON):
```json
{
  "event": "merchant_signup",
  "merchant_id": "...",
  "email": "..."
}
```
- See `/docs/API.md` for event types and payloads

## SDKs
- Official SDKs for Go, Node.js, and Python are planned
- Use REST API directly until SDKs are released

## Integration Example
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.paycrypt.tech/payment/create \
  -H "X-API-Key: <your-api-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "amount": 100, "currency": "USDT", "network": "ETH", "mode": "mainnet", "email": "customer@email.com" }'
```
